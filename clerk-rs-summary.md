# Clerk-rs: The Official Community Rust SDK for Clerk

## Overview

**Clerk-rs** is the official community-maintained Rust SDK for [Clerk](https://clerk.com), a comprehensive authentication and user management platform. This library provides Rust developers with a powerful, type-safe interface to integrate Clerk's authentication services into their applications.

## What is Clerk-rs?

Clerk-rs is a robust SDK that bridges the gap between Rust applications and Clerk's authentication API. It offers both direct API access and framework-specific middleware for popular Rust web frameworks, making it easy to add enterprise-grade authentication to Rust web applications.

## Key Features

### üîê **Complete API Coverage**
- Full implementation of the Clerk Backend API
- Support for all Clerk resources: users, sessions, organizations, invitations, and more
- Type-safe request/response models generated from Clerk's OpenAPI specification

### üöÄ **Framework Integration**
The SDK provides ready-to-use middleware and authentication guards for popular Rust web frameworks:
- **Axum** - Layer-based middleware with JWT extraction
- **Actix Web** - Middleware for route protection
- **Rocket** - Request guard system for authentication
- **Poem** - Built-in middleware support

### üîí **JWT Validation**
- Automatic JWT token validation using Clerk's JWKS (JSON Web Key Set)
- Session cookie support for same-origin requests
- Memory-cached JWKS provider for optimal performance
- Support for organization-based permissions and roles

### üì¶ **Easy Configuration**
- Simple configuration with secret keys
- Environment-based setup options
- Flexible client configuration for different deployment scenarios

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Clerk Client (`Clerk`)**: Main interface for making API requests
2. **Configuration (`ClerkConfiguration`)**: Handles authentication and API settings
3. **Validators**: Framework-specific middleware for JWT validation
4. **Models**: Type-safe representations of Clerk API resources
5. **APIs**: Organized endpoint handlers for different Clerk resources

### Supported Operations

The SDK provides access to all major Clerk API functionality:

- **User Management**: Create, update, delete, and query users
- **Session Management**: Handle user sessions and tokens
- **Organization Management**: Multi-tenant organization support
- **Authentication**: JWT validation and session verification
- **Invitations**: User invitation and onboarding flows
- **Email/SMS**: Template management and messaging
- **Webhooks**: Integration with Clerk's webhook system

## Usage Examples

### Basic API Usage
```rust
use clerk_rs::{clerk::Clerk, ClerkConfiguration, endpoints::ClerkGetEndpoint};

let config = ClerkConfiguration::new(None, None, Some("sk_test_key".to_string()), None);
let client = Clerk::new(config);
let users = client.get(ClerkGetEndpoint::GetUserList).await?;
```

### Axum Integration
```rust
use clerk_rs::validators::{axum::ClerkLayer, jwks::MemoryCacheJwksProvider};

let app = Router::new()
    .route("/protected", get(protected_handler))
    .layer(ClerkLayer::new(
        MemoryCacheJwksProvider::new(clerk), 
        Some(vec!["/protected".to_string()]), 
        true
    ));
```

### Authentication Guard
```rust
// In your route handler
async fn protected_route(Extension(clerk_jwt): Extension<ClerkJwt>) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", clerk_jwt.sub)
}
```

## Target Audiences

### üõ†Ô∏è **Rust Web Developers**
Perfect for developers building web applications in Rust who need robust authentication without the complexity of rolling their own auth system.

### üè¢ **Enterprise Applications**
Ideal for companies building multi-tenant applications with organization-based access control and complex permission systems.

### üöÄ **SaaS Builders**
Excellent choice for SaaS applications that require user management, subscription handling, and secure API access.

## Production Usage

Clerk-rs is trusted by several production applications:
- **[Tembo](https://tembo.io)** - Database-as-a-Service platform
- **[Rezon](https://rezon.ai)** - AI-powered applications
- **[Gitar](https://gitar.co)** - Git analytics platform
- **[Have I Been Squatted](https://haveibeensquatted.com)** - Domain security service

## Technical Specifications

- **Language**: Rust (2021 edition)
- **HTTP Client**: Built on reqwest with async/await support
- **JWT Processing**: Uses jsonwebtoken for secure token validation
- **Serialization**: Leverages serde for type-safe JSON handling
- **Async Runtime**: Compatible with tokio and other async runtimes

## Installation

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
clerk-rs = "0.4.1"

# Enable framework features as needed
clerk-rs = { version = "0.4.1", features = ["axum"] }
```

## Why Choose Clerk-rs?
