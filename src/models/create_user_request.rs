	/// SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS:
	/// * Always use a modern, secure hashing algorithm like Argon2id, Bcrypt, or PBKDF2 with high iteration counts
	/// * Never use deprecated algorithms like MD5 or SHA256 for new password storage
	/// * If migrating from a legacy system, use this property only for the migration process and encourage users to reset passwords

	pub password_digest: Option<String>,
	/// The hashing algorithm that was used to generate the password digest.
	///
	/// RECOMMENDED SECURE ALGORITHMS:
	/// * argon2id - Provides the best security properties and is the recommended default
	/// * argon2i - Secure but argon2id is preferred for new implementations
	/// * bcrypt - Industry standard secure algorithm
	/// * pbkdf2_sha256 - Secure with high iteration counts (min. 310,000 in 2023)
	///
	/// LEGACY/DEPRECATED ALGORITHMS (USE ONLY FOR MIGRATION):
	/// * md5 - INSECURE: Cryptographically broken, should never be used for new password storage
	/// * sha256 - INSECURE: Fast and vulnerable to brute-force when used without salt/iterations
	/// * phpass - INSECURE: Based on MD5 which is cryptographically broken
	/// * pbkdf2_sha1 - WEAK: SHA1 is considered cryptographically weak
	///
	/// Note: Password hashes using insecure algorithms (MD5, SHA256) will be automatically migrated
	/// to Bcrypt upon the user's first successful password sign-in. However, it's strongly recommended
	/// to proactively prompt users to reset their passwords rather than relying on this automatic migration.
	///
	/// ALGORITHM FORMATS:
	///
	/// **bcrypt:** The digest should be of the following form:
	/// `$<algorithm version>$<cost>$<salt & hash>`
	///
	/// **bcrypt_sha256_django:** This is the Django-specific variant of Bcrypt, using SHA256 hashing function. 
	/// The format should be as follows (as exported from Django):
	/// `bcrypt_sha256$$<algorithm version>$<cost>$<salt & hash>`
	///
	/// **md5** (INSECURE): The digest should follow the regular form e.g.:
	/// `5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99`
	///
	/// **pbkdf2_sha256:** This is the PBKDF2 algorithm using the SHA256 hashing function. The format should be as follows:
	/// `pbkdf2_sha256$<iterations>$<salt>$<hash>`
	/// Note: Both the salt and the hash are expected to be base64-encoded.
	///
	/// **pbkdf2_sha256_django:** This is the Django-specific variant of PBKDF2 and the digest should have the following format 
	/// (as exported from Django):
	/// `pbkdf2_sha256$<iterations>$<salt>$<hash>`
	/// Note: The salt is expected to be un-encoded, the hash is expected base64-encoded.
	///
	/// **pbkdf2_sha1:** This is similar to pkbdf2_sha256_django, but with two differences: 
	/// 1. uses sha1 instead of sha256 
	/// 2. accepts the hash as a hex-encoded string
	/// The format is the following:
	/// `pbkdf2_sha1$<iterations>$<salt>$<hash-as-hex-string>`
	///
	/// **phpass:** Portable public domain password hashing framework for use in PHP applications. 
	/// Digests hashed with phpass have the following sections:
	/// `$P$<rounds><salt><encoded-checksum>`
	/// - $P$ is the prefix used to identify phpass hashes.
	/// - rounds is a single character encoding a 6-bit integer representing the number of rounds used.
	/// - salt is eight characters drawn from [./0-9A-Za-z], providing a 48-bit salt.
	/// - checksum is 22 characters drawn from the same set, encoding the 128-bit checksum with MD5.
	///
	/// **scrypt_firebase:** The Firebase-specific variant of scrypt. The value is expected to have 6 segments 
	/// separated by the $ character and include the following information:
	/// _hash:_ The actual Base64 hash. This can be retrieved when exporting the user from Firebase.
	/// _salt:_ The salt used to generate the above hash. Again, this is given when exporting the user.
	/// _signer key:_ The base64 encoded signer key.
	/// _salt separator:_ The base64 encoded salt separator.
	/// _rounds:_ The number of rounds the algorithm needs to run.
	/// _memory cost:_ The cost of the algorithm run
	///
	/// The first 2 (hash and salt) are per user and can be retrieved when exporting the user from Firebase. 
	/// The other 4 values (signer key, salt separator, rounds and memory cost) are project-wide settings and 
	/// can be retrieved from the project's password hash parameters.
	///
	/// Once you have all these, you can combine it in the following format and send this as the digest in order for Clerk to accept it:
	/// `<hash>$<salt>$<signer key>$<salt separator>$<rounds>$<memory cost>`
	///
	/// **argon2i:** Algorithms in the argon2 family generate digests that encode the following information:
	/// _version (v):_ The argon version, version 19 is assumed
	/// _memory (m):_ The memory used by the algorithm (in kibibytes)
	/// _iterations (t):_ The number of iterations to perform
	/// _parallelism (p):_ The number of threads to use
	///
	/// Parts are demarcated by the `$` character, with the first part identifying the algorithm variant. 
	/// The middle part is a comma-separated list of the encoding options (memory, iterations, parallelism). 
	/// The final part is the actual digest.
	/// `$argon2i$v=19$m=4096,t=3,p=1$4t6CL3P7YiHBtwESXawI8Hm20zJj4cs7/4/G3c187e0$m7RQFczcKr5bIR0IIxbpO2P0tyrLjf3eUW3M3QSwnLc`
	///
	/// **argon2id:** See the previous algorithm for an explanation of the formatting.
	/// For the argon2id case, the value of the algorithm in the first part of the digest is `argon2id`:
	/// `$argon2id$v=19$m=64,t=4,p=8$Z2liZXJyaXNo$iGXEpMBTDYQ8G/71tF0qGjxRHEmR3gpGULcE93zUJVU`
	///
	/// **sha256** (INSECURE): The digest should be a 64-length hex string, e.g.:
	/// `9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08`
